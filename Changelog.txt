Sonic Candle 1.1.11
------------------
-Added color pickers
-Added splash screen (shown when opening a jar made with Gradle)

Sonic Candle 1.1.10
------------------
-Fixed dead bar

Sonic Candle 1.1.9
------------------
-Mp3 Support added! Now users may import Mp3 files into Sonic Candle!
	Works by converting the mp3 file into a wav
	The wav file is stored in the OS default temporary file
	When the user exits the temporary wav file is deleted
	This keeps things clean and the user doesn't have to worry about files popping up everywhere

-Better file filtering (forces users to use files that Sonic Candle supports)

Sonic Candle 1.1.8
------------------
-⁠Dark Nimbus look

-⁠Made it so preview frame can't be 0 or below

-Added in file filters for JFileChooser (easier to sort through messy folders that have a lot of files)

-⁠Made panels fixed size so they don't dynamically change

-⁠Pop Up and Etched block renderers (simulate depth with the blocks)

-Filled and Outlined Oval renderers (to be kind of like a sharp round rectangle. I think it looks neat as it gets sharper the louder it is)
